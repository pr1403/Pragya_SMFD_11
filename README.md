# Stochastic Modelling of Financial Derivatives  
**Project Type**: Stamatics Project (Ongoing)  

---

#### Objective  
- Developed advanced models for derivative pricing using probability, stochastic calculus, and stochastic differential equation (SDE) simulations  

---

#### Approach  
- Strengthened foundation in probability, Markov chains, and martingales for asset pricing and arbitrage theory  
- Studied European, Asian, and Passport options; derived pricing from first principles using financial theory  
- Modeled asset dynamics using Brownian motion and Geometric Brownian Motion (GBM) to capture stochastic market behavior  
- Leveraged Itô calculus for Black-Scholes-Merton (BSM) PDE model derivation and employed both analytical and simulation-based solutions  
- Built Monte Carlo simulations for European options; extended models to the Heston framework with stochastic volatility  

---

#### Impact  
- Reduced model pricing error against implied volatility by 15–20% through surface calibration on NSE options  
- Simulated stochastic differential equations and applied the Heston model to replicate volatility smiles in real markets  
- Achieved high-accuracy pricing via BSM and Monte Carlo simulations under the risk-neutral framework
